    <h2>Message from the developer</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Thank you for visiting the website. During the creation of this website, I learned more about javascript during the creation
        of study clock and the todo list. <br>I expanded my knowledge of CSS and implented animations with CSS.<br> I faced many challenges during the
        making of the website, however, the website turns out to a useful fully functioning website with custom styling and javascript. 
    </p>
